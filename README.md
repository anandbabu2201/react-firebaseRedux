# react_clientpanel_fb

This app contains a authentication with Firebase.

I have developed this app to store the clients data with balance. Basically user can login and add newclient data or they can modify the existing data of the client or their balance as soon as they update it, it will go and store in firebase database.

I have given authentication specifics as well .For example if user don't have account they can register by clicking on the register button at the same time i have given option to Register off or on button so that it won't allow any users to register.

you can check the app by clicking on the below link and play around.

user name : - test@example.com
password : - password
